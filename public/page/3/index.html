            I&rsquo;ve gotten approached by a fair amount of &ldquo;entrepreneurs&rdquo; recently. Granted this is completely my fault; I put my name up on the NYU Entreprenurship Lab&rsquo;s wall under developers. And putting all the jokes and snarky remarks aside, there&rsquo;s a lot of genuine misunderstanding between these entrepreneurs and developers. I want to clear some of them up with some &ldquo;rules of engagement&rdquo; for developers.
So let&rsquo;s say you are the founder of a startup called Breakr, Tinder for break dancers.

            I&rsquo;ve become interested in programming languages recently. This interest stemmed from Bob Nystrom&rsquo;s wonderful book Crafting Interpreters. Reading the book, with all the wonderful diagrams and simple code snippets, has given me the idea of writing my own language. However, what kind of language should I make? Right now it feels like the programming world is bursting at the seams with new languages. Golang, Kotlin, Swift, and Rust have all appeared within the past few years.

            Hi! This is my first post on the new Horribly Underqualified. I created the original version of this blog last year. However, it quickly fell out of use, partially because I found a job and partially because I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to maintain the Rails app it was built upon. For this blog I&rsquo;ve decided to take another route. I&rsquo;m using Hugo, a static site generator. That way I can have a blog with minimal effort, while also having it look (significantly) nicer than the previous iteration.
