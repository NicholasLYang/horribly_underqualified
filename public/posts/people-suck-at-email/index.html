<p>Expect to send at least a couple follow up emails. If the person you
are emailing is famous or important or a leader of some sorts, expect
to send even more emails. They have a lot on your mind and your email
can slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>In general assume forgetfulness or laziness before malice.</p>
