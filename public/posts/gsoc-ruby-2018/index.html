            <p>My Google Summer of Code project for Ruby is coming to an end. In a
nutshell, the project was to add type annotations to Ruby. When I
first approached this problem, my thoughts were &ldquo;this is just a
syntatical change, this shouldn&rsquo;t be hard&rdquo;. Haha, yeah, that wasn&rsquo;t
quite true. While I did end up adding type annotations, I didn&rsquo;t
manage to complete all of my goals, and the ones that I did complete,
I did by the skin of my teeth. Why couldn&rsquo;t I complete my goals? What
happened? Was I simply too lazy? Well yes, but wait, there&rsquo;s more!</p>
<p>When I first started the project, I had never seen the Ruby codebase
before. Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t really think I was going to get accepted to
GSoC, as the precise feature I proposed had already been <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9999">rejected by
Matz</a>. But to my surprise, I
was accepted into the program, for which I am endlessly grateful to my
mentor <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/">Tony Arcieri</a>.</p>
<p>So when GSoC started, I forked the repo, cloned it, and immediately
attempted to understand the parser. The Ruby parser is a LALR parser
generated by Bison contained in a single file <code>parse.y</code> that numbers
over 11k lines. For context, the only file larger than <code>parse.y</code> that
are actual source code files (not counting JIT headers, configure
files or libraries) is <code>io.c</code> at 13,270 lines.</p>
<p>Anyways, I began reading <code>parse.y</code> and attempting to understand
it. The first mistake I made was attempting to understand the entire
file. With a codebase of this size, basically any function call or
macro will lead you down a rabbit hole. I remember trying to trace the
YYMALLOC calls, which lead to having to understand various structs
with other nested structs, and having to understand how Ruby
implements its own heap, and other various minutae. I attempted to do
this for a bit. What didn&rsquo;t help was that since <code>parse.y</code> is not
strictly speaking a C file, all of my navigation tools like ggtags
didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I also taught myself the basics of Bison. I already
knew some stuff about parsing from <a href="http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting
Interpreters</a> and had written
some simple recursive descent parsers before. Therefore, Bison wasn&rsquo;t
too much of a reach. I will say that Bison&rsquo;s overall documentation
isn&rsquo;t fantastic. Often times when I learn a new tool, I read a couple
different tutorials. That way a topic that I may have found confusing
in one tutorial will be reinforced by a different tutorial. Plus, if I
get bored with one tutorial I can always switch to a different
one. For Bison, first there&rsquo;s a real dearth of tutorials. Sure,
there&rsquo;s a lot of slides and theoretical documents on Bison, but
there&rsquo;s not a lot of hands on, real world information.</p>
<p>Thus, I ended up using the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html">Bison
manual</a> a lot,
which was pretty informative. However, even the most complicated
example in the Bison manual was essentially a fancy
calculator. Compared to the complex beast that is the Ruby grammar,
that&rsquo;s not exactly equivalent.</p>
<p>Sidenote, I&rsquo;ve noticed a severe lack of hands on, cookbook style books
or tutorials on programming language topics (other than Crafting
Interpreters). A book that would cover topics like &ldquo;here&rsquo;s how to make
a package manager&rdquo; or &ldquo;how to write a simple typechecker&rdquo; would be
extremely valuable. I get that books like the Dragon book are great
and all, but I really don&rsquo;t want to read 100 pages on parsing theory
just to get to the point where I can write a simple parser.</p>
<p>Anyways, armed with some basic Bison knowledge, I decided to dive into
<code>parse.y</code> again. My mentor, Tony, gave me some nice resources,
including <a href="https://github.com/whitequark/parser">a parser</a> written by
whitequark. In addition, whitequark helped translate a chapter from
the Ruby Hacking Guide, a book in Japanese about the Ruby source
code. This chapter covered the Ruby lexer, which, not gonna lie, is
pretty insane. Essentially, the lexer requires a lot of context
specific information, such as whether the lexer is lexing a function
name, whether it&rsquo;s at the beginning of an expression, etc. The way
that this is done is through a finite state machine. The parser sets
the lexer state at various grammar rules. Depending on the lexer
state, you&rsquo;ll get different tokens or even errors, so this is pretty
important. I&rsquo;ll return to this for&hellip;reasons.</p>
<p>With all of this info, I started to take <a href="https://github.com/NicholasLYang/gsoc-2018-ruby-types">some
notes</a> on the
parser. While I didn&rsquo;t end up getting too far with the notes, this was
pretty useful to organize my thoughts. Eventually, I figured out
enough about the grammar to add a new option to <code>f_norm_arg</code>,
essentially the rule for a normal argument (Ruby has a few different
kinds of arguments, such as keyword args and default args). Tony and I
had decided in a colon to delimit types. Interestingly enough, Ruby
doesn&rsquo;t have a tCOLON token. Instead, the Bison file just uses a
literal &lsquo;:'. While that&rsquo;s fine for the ternary operator (the only case
where it&rsquo;s used), we wanted an explicit token for the type rule. I
added a tCOLON token, which was pretty easy, since the lexer code
outside of the states is pretty simple.</p>
<p>I also noticed some interesting decisions with the grammar rules. For
instance, Ruby does not have a function declaration grammar
rule. Instead, it is grouped along with a bunch of other rules in a
gigantic primary rule. This means that changing function grammar rules
can be kind of tricky.</p>
<p>However, it was after implementing argument type signatures where I
got stuck. You see, adding the annotations to the parser was only the
first part of the project. The second, and arguably more important
part was to add output to Ripper, Ruby&rsquo;s parser library. After all,
these annotations are meaningless unless a third party can utilize
them. Ripper provides this third party access. It allows Ruby
developers to parse Ruby code into an s-expression form. And from the
outside, adding the type annotations to Ruby should be rather simple,
no?</p>
<p>Well, no. I already discussed some of the issues with Ripper in <a href="https://horriblyunderqualified.com/posts/wtf-ruby-pt-1/">this
post</a>. Basically,
Ripper uses an embedded domain specific language within <code>parse.y</code>
which is then converted to <code>ripper.y</code> with a quite ridiculous Ruby
script, which is then run through Bison and converted into a <code>.so</code>
file which is then imported by Ripper. This took a while to figure
out, as there wasn&rsquo;t much existing documentation on Ripper.</p>
<p>There were some other interesting aspects of Ripper, which I might get
around to writing about, such as the <code>dispatch</code> macros that would call
Ruby functions manually into the VM. Or the metaprogramming aliases
that link to these functions. It&rsquo;s a bit crazy.</p>
<p>Anyways, while this was happening, I decided to take a short break and
implement return type signatures. This also ended up kind of
tricky. I&rsquo;d implement the return type and get a lot of weird syntax
errors (kind of funny that syntax errors imply an issue in the
interpreter, not an issue in the code). For instance, I&rsquo;d get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>ruby/lib/fileutils.rb:1654: syntax error, unexpected :: at EXPR_BEG, expecting keyword_end (SyntaxError)
    ::FileUtils::LOW_METHODS.map {|...
    ^~
</code></pre><p>The code for context:</p>
<pre><code>	  def _do_nothing(*)end
    ::FileUtils::LOW_METHODS.map {|name| alias_method name, :_do_nothing}
</code></pre><p>Which&hellip;by the way is not a great error message. If I received that
without knowing that <code>EXPR_BEG</code> is a lexer state, I&rsquo;d find that pretty
confusing. Anyways, I struggled with that one for a while. I tried
moving around the various existing actions, changing the lexer state,
etc. I even added a unique token (&lsquo;=&raquo;&rsquo; or tDASSOC) and used that as
the return type symbol:</p>
<pre><code>'(' f_args rparen tDASSOC type_sig
</code></pre><p>Given that this should be completely unambiguous, it was kind of
frustrating that it didn&rsquo;t work. Furthermore, the error message didn&rsquo;t
even make much sense. Using the debugger mode for the Ruby parser, I
figured out that when the code was parsed correctly, the lexer was in
the EXPR_BEG state. So&hellip;yeah.</p>
<p>After banging my head against this wall for a bit, I decided to look
around for other people&rsquo;s implementations of type
annotations. Eventually I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/github/ruby/tree/2.1+type-annotations">this
branch</a> on
GitHub&rsquo;s fork of Ruby. To my surprise, when I implemented the rules in
this format, it worked! I had to do some minor tweaking, as how Ruby
sets lexer states changed since 2.1. I still don&rsquo;t exactly know why
this works. My best guess is that it has to do with the
<code>p-&gt;command_start = TRUE</code> line I put in, since I&rsquo;m fairly sure that&rsquo;s
the main difference.</p>
<p>I will admit, it&rsquo;s pretty bittersweet that I didn&rsquo;t get to figure out
this on my own, but simply relied on someone else&rsquo;s code. On the other
hand, I&rsquo;ll take the working code.</p>
<p>After that, I continued my work on Ripper. I tried a few different
approaches, such as adding an annotation to the DSL for type
signatures, using an existing one for constant path references, such
as <code>Foo::Bar</code>, etc. None of them stuck.</p>
<p>Then I examined how Ripper actually does function
arguments. Interestingly enough, function arguments are done by
calling a function called <code>new_args</code>, which, depending on whether or
not you&rsquo;re parsing for Ripper or for the interpreter, goes to
different functions (this is an unfortunate pattern in <code>parse.y</code> that
is achieved via the C preprocessor). This function is essentially an
alias for a dispatch with params as the function name. Which via some
sort of magic gets turned into an sexpr with params as the
name. Pretty much straight forward as far as Ripper is concerned.</p>
<p>However, one thing I noticed, was that the arguments were of type
<code>VALUE</code>, which is pretty much the least useful type in existence. It&rsquo;s
a <code>u_intptr_t</code> which doesn&rsquo;t print out nicely and tells you zero about
what&rsquo;s actually going on. Interestingly enough, all the grammar rules
output <code>VALUE's</code> in Ripper, which makes even less sense. After all,
how do you connect the values into a tree, like a normal parser?</p>
<p>I then tried some other modifications, such as changing the function
calls, printing out various info, etc. None worked. None even changed
the output of Ripper. What then dawned upon me is a simple yet
slightly horrifying realization. What if I&rsquo;m testing the wrong Ripper?
Now, the reason this hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me before was fairly
simple. When you give Ripper incorrect syntax, it returns nil instead
of the s-expression syntax (which is terrible for error handling by
the way). Since Ripper wasn&rsquo;t returning nil for the type annotations,
but it was returning nil when I tried using the type annotations on
the trunk branch, I figured I was using the correct version of Ripper.</p>
<p>BUT, there&rsquo;s a caveat here. Since Ripper relies on a <code>.so</code> file, which
it imports via Ruby&rsquo;s require, I realized that it&rsquo;s quite possible
that it&rsquo;s importing an old <code>.so</code> file. Now, this wouldn&rsquo;t explain why
none of my changes are showing up while the type annotations parse
correctly, but I supposed it was worth a shot.</p>
<p>At that point, I decided to try to make a trivial change to Ripper on
the main trunk branch and see if it is visible. I choose a fairly
simple one: since Ruby function arguments don&rsquo;t require parenthesis, I
just removed the <code>paren!</code> annotation in that rule. Simple. I compile,
build a new version of Ruby, and boom, no change. Therefore, there
should be something wrong with the version of Ripper that I&rsquo;m using,
no?</p>
<p>I then examine the require path. I add a basic print statement to
print out the location of the file once it&rsquo;s been
required. And&hellip;nope, it&rsquo;s the right file. I even switched it to a
<code>load</code> with the exact unambiguous path and it still didn&rsquo;t work. So
yeah, that&rsquo;s where I ended. I have no clue why my changes aren&rsquo;t
appearing.</p>
<p>Frankly it&rsquo;s been a long and frustrating process. I do want to finish
this project, but right now I kind of want a break. I&rsquo;ve had to do a
lot of detective work and careful reading and rereading.</p>
<p>If I had to give myself some feedback, I&rsquo;d say the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take notes about everything. Keep a journal that you can update
about all the different methods you&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do more preliminary research before trying to write stuff on your
own. Email people, talk to others and get an idea of the context
that your project is in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t understand everything. Isolate the subset
that you want or need to understand and focus on that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to do something else instead of just being stuck or
procrastinating. I definitely had some times where I should have
just tossed some part back and worked on a different aspect of my
code. But instead I tried to just keep on grinding and would end up
frustrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always do the simplest possible modification first. Don&rsquo;t try
anything fancy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, if I were to give some suggestions about Ruby (as a
highly inexperienced insolent developer), here are a few ordered from
possible to less possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>parse.y</code> seriously needs to be split up and cleaned up. Something
as simple as some comments and a little reorganization would do
wonders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ripper is very very confusing and needs to be either refactored or
rewritten entirely. Adding a DSL via comments and overriding
functions using the C preprocessor just to add an API into the
parser is not exactly great. It&rsquo;s confusing, hard to modify and I&rsquo;m
not even sure how many people are actively using it. Plus there&rsquo;s
little to no documentation. As far as I can tell, <code>Ripper#parse</code>
doesn&rsquo;t even do anything!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ruby parser should be decoupled from anything else. I&rsquo;ve noticed
a lot of intermixed code in <code>parse.y</code>. There&rsquo;s various connections
to compilation, some testing, the Ripper manual calls into the Ruby
virtual machine, etc. In my view, the parser shouldn&rsquo;t be concerned
with all of this. The parser should parse to a simple, platform
independent, usage independent format. After that, what the
interpreter does with the format is out of the parser&rsquo;s purview. It
can compile it to bytecode, export it via a library, heck it could
turn it into a visualization. I understand that this was not done by
design and that there are probably a lot of excellent reasons why
the parser was written this way. But at this point, it&rsquo;s pretty
tricky to write extensions for Ruby. If the parser was independent
of the bytecode compiler, I could conceivably see extensions to Ruby
that just act like a pipeline for the parse tree:</p>
<pre><code>Parse Tree -&gt; Typechecker -&gt; Parse Tree
</code></pre><p>Or even:</p>
<pre><code>Parse Tree -&gt; Static Analyzer -&gt; Parse Tree
</code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>The Ruby parser kinda needs to be rewritten. Sure, when Ruby was
first written, Bison was probably the best option for parsing. But
there&rsquo;s a lot of baggage that comes with Bison. It&rsquo;s hard to debug,
it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to introspect (tooling is straight up
non-existent), and it imposes a lot of odd constraints (e.g. single
file). Sure, this is pretty presumptuous of me to say, as I&rsquo;m not
even half as skilled as the rest of the Ruby team, but comparing the
code for the new MJIT to <code>parse.y</code> is kind of depressing. The MJIT
code has comments, clear names, goto definition works, etc. The
parser relies on stateful lexing, comment DSLs and various other
hacks to work around Bison&rsquo;s limitations. The old school YY- names
aren&rsquo;t very clear either. A new parser written by hand would allow
for significantly better error handling, better ways of resolving
stateful lexing (communication between the lexer and the parser))
and would be a lot easier to read. Heck, I&rsquo;d do it if I weren&rsquo;t
A. very inexperienced, B. currently in school and C. interested in
other projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to give my thanks to Tony, my mentor for being extremely
helpful in his advice. I&rsquo;d also like to thank Yusuke Endoh (mame) for
taking the time to answer my questions. Furthermore, I&rsquo;d like to thank
Matz and the Ruby team as a whole for making such a great
language. It&rsquo;s been an invaluable experience learning about one of my
favorite languages. Finally, I&rsquo;d like to thank Google for funding
these projects. It&rsquo;s pretty awesome being able to get paid for open
source contributions. I hope that I can continue to contribute to both
Ruby and to other important open source projects.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Nicholas</p>
