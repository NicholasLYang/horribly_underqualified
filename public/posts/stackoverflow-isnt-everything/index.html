<p>And to an extent it&rsquo;s true. StackOverflow is a pretty essential tool
in a modern developer&rsquo;s kit. I&rsquo;ve used it a lot, for everything from
iOS code signing issues to Rails bugs. However, as I&rsquo;ve progressed in
my projects, I&rsquo;ve started to use StackOverflow less and less. There&rsquo;s
a few reasons for this.</p>
<p>For one, there are problems where StackOverflow straight up doesn&rsquo;t
help. Problems such as writing your own language, or working with
obscure tools or libraries that don&rsquo;t have a whole lot of
users. Basically, if you&rsquo;re going into territory no man (or woman) has
been before, it&rsquo;s unlikely StackOverflow can help you. For instance,
the chances I&rsquo;ll get a decent answer about the inner workings of the
Ruby interpreter through SO are pretty much slim to none.</p>
<p>Second, there&rsquo;s time limits. If you <em>shudder</em>, actually ask a question
on SO instead of just looking at previous answers, you might be
looking at a few hours or even a few days before you get a good
answer. That&rsquo;s not a knock against SO, quality takes time. But
sometimes when you have a hard deadline, or are just impatient like
me, a few days isn&rsquo;t good enough.</p>
<p>And finally, if you&rsquo;re working on the cutting edge, let&rsquo;s say a
prerelease beta of your favorite JS library, or a version of a
language you build from source, then chances are the well intentioned
advice of most StackOverflow users might not apply. Again, not their
fault, just special situation.</p>
<p>So what do you do? Do you curl up into a ball and wait the time until
you get a StackOverflow answer? Do you give up and quit programming?
Well, you <em>could</em>, or you could do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Open an issue</strong> This is especially useful if you&rsquo;re working on
the cutting edge prerelease alpha build, or if you&rsquo;re working on
something that requires niche knowledge that only a few developers
have. Usually in good open source projects people are fairly
responsive and polite. They&rsquo;ll help you with your issue, and maybe
even add new functionality to their software if you ask
politely. Most projects these days use GitHub, but even if they&rsquo;re
using a mailing list or a bug tracker, issues are a great way to
get involved in the open source community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Email someone</strong> This is a bit more direct, so it depends on how
urgent your issue is. Often times developers will have a public
email, either on their GitHub or personal website. Of course, don&rsquo;t
do this for your average &ldquo;I forgot a semicolon&rdquo; issue. But it&rsquo;s
fantastic for issues that are specific, somewhat technically
interesting or very very urgent. Just be polite and remember they
aren&rsquo;t your personal tech support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read a book</strong> Contrary to popular belief, programming books
didn&rsquo;t suddenly disappear once StackOverflow became a
thing. There&rsquo;s plenty of great, informative books on basically
every topic imaginable. Not only can they provide good insight into
certain languages and tools, they can give more depth and thought
than even the most thorough Jon Skeet answer. Need an answer that
requires real, capitalized Computer Science? Read a book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read the damn code</strong> Can&rsquo;t make heads or tails of your issue?
Have an error that isn&rsquo;t understandable? Find the source code,
clone the repo and read the damn code. It&rsquo;s fast, effective and you
don&rsquo;t have to talk to anybody. Social interaction? <strong>The
horror</strong>. Not to mention, you also gain a deeper understanding of
the code you&rsquo;re using. Which means you can be the one to answer the
next StackOverflow question on this topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Patch the damn code</strong> Let&rsquo;s say you did read the code. You read
it and there&rsquo;s a glaring issue with the code. Maybe they forgot to
take into account some issue you&rsquo;re having. Maybe it&rsquo;s just
buggy. Well sure you could wait for someone to hold your hand and
fix the code. Or you could fork the repo and just fix it your damn
self. You get experience, open source street cred, and your problem
is solved as fast as you can patch.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And really, depending on StackOverflow for everything is kinda sad. I
get that it&rsquo;s a joke, but behind the joke is a very true reality:
Developers aren&rsquo;t honing their problem solving skills but instead just
relying on StackOverflow to think for them. But really, limiting
yourself to StackOverflow is limiting yourself to what StackOverflow
contributors can help you with. You can&rsquo;t push the envelope or try new
things if you just rely on StackOverflow.</p>
