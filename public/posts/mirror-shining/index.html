            <p>One of my earliest programming projects was for my Intro to Computer
Science class in high school. The assignment was to create a game in
NetLogo. NetLogo, for those who are not familiar, is a program where
users can control &ldquo;turtles&rdquo; and &ldquo;patches&rdquo;, basically agents and the
squares they move on. Users can move the turtles, which can in turn
paint the patches they traverse.</p>
<p>I decided to make a simple platformer with a twist&mdash;the map was to be
encased in darkness except for a bubble of light. I started this
project early, having been bitten by a previous project that I may
have started the day before it was due. I remember getting the core
functionality down, such as the basic jumping physics (literally just
up and to the right/left, I didn&rsquo;t want to program actual physics);
the bubble of light that slowly expanded; level loading, etc. However,
after I finished the core functionality, I didn&rsquo;t stop.  I implemented
shooting projectiles and basic enemies. I added trapdoors that dropped
the player into deadly lava when stepped upon. I wanted users to be
amazed at all the functionality this game had. None of these features
were essential or required. I simply wanted to build them anyways.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know it then, but what I was doing was not
unusual. Programmers by nature like to improve their code. Whether
that&rsquo;s adding features or refactoring or adding scalability, we love
to constantly improve our projects. I like to call this habit &ldquo;mirror
shining&rdquo;. Much as some people love to obsess about giving their shoes
a mirror shine, programmers love to obsess about their code.</p>
<p>Now, this is the usual section in the blog post structure where I&rsquo;m
supposed to make a point for how mirror shining is bad and how we
should all stop doing it. But that&rsquo;s not true. Mirror shining is
perfectly fine. Compared to a similar term, &ldquo;bikeshedding&rdquo;, mirror
shining isn&rsquo;t wasting time on useless details. Instead, it&rsquo;s dealing
with fundamental, often crucial points, such as improving user
experience or refactoring messy code, or scalability. It&rsquo;s about going
beyond what is merely required and building a product that is truly
admirable.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to recognize when mirror shining is advisable
and when it is not. For instance, a web application that will be
continually used and maintained is a perfect case for mirror
shining. All the little details and finishing touches will play a
factor in maintenance, usability and overall customer
satisfaction. But if a company gives a 2 day take home project for a
job application? Maybe a multithreaded async S C A L A B L E webserver
isn&rsquo;t needed. Maybe a custom responsive UI with extra fancy animations
is a little much.</p>
<p>Having said that, would I still have put as much work into my project?
Certainly. After all, God is in the details.</p>
