<meta property="og:description" content="Hi! This is my first post on the new Horribly Underqualified. I created the original version of this blog last year. However, it quickly fell out of use, partially because I found a job and partially because I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to maintain the Rails app it was built upon. For this blog I&rsquo;ve decided to take another route. I&rsquo;m using Hugo, a static site generator. That way I can have a blog with minimal effort, while also having it look (significantly) nicer than the previous iteration." />

            <p>Hi! This is my first post on the new Horribly Underqualified. I
created the original version of this blog last year. However, it
quickly fell out of use, partially because I found a job and partially
because I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to maintain the Rails app it was built
upon. For this blog I&rsquo;ve decided to take another route. I&rsquo;m using
Hugo, a static site generator. That way I can have a blog with minimal
effort, while also having it look (significantly) nicer than the
previous iteration.</p>
<p>I might port over some writing from the old blog, but probably not
most of the posts. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll keep this blog relatively up to
date. If not, at least it&rsquo;s low maintenance.</p>
