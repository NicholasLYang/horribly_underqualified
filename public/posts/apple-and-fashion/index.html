            <p>Go online and you&rsquo;ll find particularly potent venom directed towards
Apple. Critics denigrate their products as overpriced,
underpowered<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> scams that only uninformed dolts would buy. Others
insist that Apple has become unduly obsessed with aesthetics. They
perpetually raise the question: Do people <em>really</em> want thinner
phones? Do people <em>really</em> need a lighter laptop?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, yes. People do want a thinner phone. They
do want a lighter laptop. Why? Because <strong>fashion</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk clothes. Clothes aren&rsquo;t something a lot of nerds think
about. Which is quite weird in my opinion. It&rsquo;s a very easy thing to
think about with a lot of potential upside. But I digress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two schools of thought towards clothes: Cargo shorts or no
cargo shorts. This is a vast oversimplification and probable false
dichotomy, but it&rsquo;ll suffice for this post.</p>
<p>The cargo shorts camp chooses clothes based on utility. Cargo shorts
have plenty of pockets so therefore they are better than normal
shorts. Raincoats keep rain off, so I should always wear a
raincoat. Running shoes are comfortable so I&rsquo;ll wear running shoes.</p>
<p>The non cargo shorts camp chooses clothes based on, well, not
utility. Most commonly aesthetics, or in the parlance of Tan France,
fuckability. These pants show off my ass. This shirt&rsquo;s color looks
great in the sun. These sunglasses accentuate my face.</p>
<p>Both camps have valid points. Looking good is a very valid pursuit for
a person, but always with a healthy dose of pragmatism. High heels?
Great. Stilettos on concrete? Maybe not. Very nice Burberry trench
coat? Wonderful. On a hike? Nope. Wearing stretchy pants because
they&rsquo;re comfy? Sure. Wearing sweatpants all the time? Ehhh.</p>
<p>But what both camps should probably agree on is that one should not
criticize a fashion company for making clothes that are aesthetically
pleasing but not maximally practical.</p>
<p>So why do people critique Apple for producing devices that are
aesthetically pleasing but perhaps not maximally practical? Why do
they complain that Apple focuses so much on aesthetics?</p>
<p>And oh man are other companies firmly entrenched on the cargo shorts
side. It&rsquo;s baffling to me how ugly, how cheap-looking, how <em>bad</em> non
Mac compulers look. How ThinkPads use that eternal dorky grey
plastic. How the Microsoft Surface Book can&rsquo;t be opened without
awkwardly anchoring the bottom half. How most laptops <em>still</em> have
those inane stickers reminding us that we&rsquo;re using an Intel
processor. How even the most aesthetically pleasing of laptops just do
a poor imitation of a Mac.</p>
<p>But Nicholas, you say, clothes&rsquo; specs are far less important than that
of a computer. Fine. Then let&rsquo;s take cars as our example.  Cars do
have specs. They have mileage, seat count, max speed, etc. Would you
ever criticize a car company for making a car that just maaaybe
doesn&rsquo;t have the best mileage or maybe not the best engine, but looks
fantastic? Probably not. You&rsquo;d be criticizing the entire American auto
industry.</p>
<p>People do not need maximally efficient cars. They do not need
maximally efficient computers. Most people drive their car to
work. Most people use their computer to check their email and watch
YouTube. Complaining that people are buying nice looking cars when
they could be buying a cheaper, uglier car that you can use to drag
race is completely missing the point, especially when you&rsquo;re talking
to people who do not and will never drag race in their life.</p>
<p>Of course with clothes and cars and computers, the product must
ultimately be usable. I don&rsquo;t begrudge any criticisms towards Apple
about malfunctioning computers or buggy software. Nobody should accept
broken products.</p>
<p>One last kvetch, why do people assume Apple just doesn&rsquo;t know what
they&rsquo;re doing?  Like, it&rsquo;s one thing to guess a company isn&rsquo;t running
optimally. It&rsquo;s a complete other thing to assume they&rsquo;re profoundly
stupid. Like whenever Apple shaves some inches off the iPhone or makes
the screen slightly bigger, or whatever, people always comment
questioning why they made it thinner or why the screen is larger or
whatever. Why? Well probably because they tested it on people, and
people liked the thinner phone. Contrary to Apple promotional
materials, Jony Ive doesn&rsquo;t just sit in a while void dictating the
next iPhone, chamfered edges and all.</p>
<p>Apple is far from a perfect company. But criticizing it for
prioritizing aesthetics over functionality is like complaining that
Balenciaga sells shorts that aren&rsquo;t cargo shorts.</p>

<p>Y&rsquo;know, this is commonly repeated but I actually believe it&rsquo;s
quite overexaggerated. Perhaps back in the day this was more true,
but Apple computers are quite impressive in some regards such as
SSD speed. Try finding a computer with an equivalent chassis,
processor and SSD for cheaper. It&rsquo;s not easy. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
