<p>This blog is written by me, Nicholas Yang. I am currently a junior at
NYU studying computer science and mathematics. I am interning at
Microsoft for summer 2019. I like to read, program and cook. Some of
my interests include functional programming, compilers and language
design. I&rsquo;m also interested in user interfaces and creating intuitive,
beautiful design.</p>
<p>The blog name is a tongue in cheek allusion to how many young (and not
young) developers feel while applying for jobs; completely hopelessly,
horribly underqualified. My hope is that I can provide some semblance
of reassurance that no, you are not horribly underqualified. The blog
is built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a static site
generator. It&rsquo;s hosted on Amazon&rsquo;s S3 service with Cloudfront and
Route 53. The domain was bought with Gandi.</p>
