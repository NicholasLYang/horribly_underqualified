This blog is written by me, Nicholas Yang. I am currently a sophomore
at NYU studying computer science and mathematics. I will be interning
at Microsoft for summer 2019. I like to read, program and cook. Some
of my interests include functional programming, compilers and language
design. I'm also interested in user interfaces and creating intuitive,
beautiful design.


The blog name is a tongue in cheek allusion to how many young (and not
young) developers feel while applying for jobs; completely hopelessly,
horribly underqualified. My hope is that I can provide some semblance
of reassurance that no, you are not horribly underqualified. The blog
is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site
generator. It's hosted on Amazon's S3 service with Cloudfront and
Route 53. The domain was bought with Gandi.
