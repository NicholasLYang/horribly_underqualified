We open with a shot of Lily crying. Eh. Not my favorite acting moment
but okay. There's a montage Sergei's body and the fuel can, some other
Devs workers, etc. Always with that same insipid camera
pans/tracks. We see a shot of what appears to be a fight in a car
park; Katie looking sad; Nick Offerman looking sad and slamming a
table. Cut to intro title.

Forest gives Lily a standard dramatic loss speech, relating his loss
of his young daughter. The sort of speech that "hints" that his
character miiiight not be over the death. I put "hints" in quotes
because, well, his company is covered in little girl branding, has a
gigantic little girl statue and is named after his goddamn
daughter. Subtle.

Cut to Forest driving his remarkably middling car to his remarkably
middling house. Nobody is home. There's a pristine children's bedroom,
complete with a creepy doll. Really hammering the dead daughter theme,
ain't we?

Lily has a conversation with her mom, who is apparently in Hong Kong
(I thought she was third gen?) and thinks her daughter doesn't have
friends. She's not wrong. Lily lies and says she has friends taking
care of her, while we see her alone on the couch. It's a solid
juxtaposition between conversation and setting. Of course, there's a
heaping of pedantic music on top of this conversation for no
reason. What is it about overusing music? It's just manipulative.

After trying the password one more time and failing, Lily sneaks into
Jamie's house (surprise surprise he's back) via the fire escape. Jamie
is, of course, gaming and blankly saying brilliant lines like "I
died". Can a programmer character for once have a hobby other than
video games? Also why did Jamie have to be reintroduced immediately?
I'm a huge fan of reintroducing characters late. Let viewers forget
about the character, then bring them back.

Jamie breaks into the app, hand waving that it's an older
version. Sure, whatever. There's a little bit of clunkiness where Lily
claims she doesn't understand so that Jamie can give some more
exposition, which is pretty unrealistic since her specialty is
encryption.

Turns out it's a Russian state messaging app. Jamie warns Lily that
there might be security which triggers when he cracks the app. Lily
responds to push ahead and crack the app. Which, I dunno, if I were
Jamie I'd probably have reservations about barking up Russian state
affairs. But that's just me.

Lily hugs Jamie before leaving. Which could be nothing, but if it's
the beginning of a relationship, that would be extremely
disappointing and not fitting with Lily's arc.

Cut to Forest looking at some code in his creepy little home (pretty
unrealistic---big tech CEOs don't program that much) before having
another classic coded conversation with the slightly-racist head of
security. 'nother mysterious throwaway line about how quitting smoking
doesn't matter. Maybe this project is some way to be immortal? Or
they're all gonna be dead anyways? Intriguing. Kenton, the head of
security, appears to want Forest to move on. I guess he noticed the
gigantic girl statue.

This trope of "mad scientist grappling with loss driven to extreme
measures" trope is getting a little old. Fringe, Arrival, Westworld,
Mr Robot all tread this ground. There's more themes in sci-fi than
loss, y'know?

Cut to the Devs team, an older developer, Stewart (looked this up on
IMDB) and a younger one, Lyndon (I think?), are bantering as Katie
watches. They're working on this simulation that appears to be of, dun
dun, Jesus Christ's crucifixion. Huh. Honestly expected this reveal
later. Well that's...interesting. Not "lose your shit in the bathroom"
crazy but, y'know, it's definitely some world changing tech.

Lily checks the messages while moooore pedantic music plays. Because
this totally wouldn't be a tense moment without the music. She decides
to send a message, which, hey girl, you want to play with Russian
intelligence, that's on you. She gets a response, yadda yadda they set
up a meet and the dude wipes the phone. Hope Jamie got a
backup. There's some nice electronic scare chords on the wipe. I know,
I just complained about the music but sometimes it's nice.

She meets the Russian handler who's a pretty nice guy named
Anton. Anton...does not have a great Russian accent. When I can tell
that, that's not a great sign. Anton and Lily have a nice classic
skeptical conversation where Anton claims to be helping Lily, Lily
responds she doesn't believe him (why not go along with it while you
can?) or know him. Sergei too. Anton goes on a nice sappy monologue
about how Sergei loved Lily and that she did know him. Anton tries to
recruit Lily and she refuses. Again, not sure I'd do that to a Russian
intelligence agent.

Anton tells Lily that Sergei did not commit suicide. Surprise
surprise. He tells her to contact her then leaves. Our old pal Kenton
turns out to be watching (I guess he followed Lily?).

Back to Devs, Stewart is celebrating while Forest and Katie are doing
the classic "this isn't good enough, we need to do the impossible"
shtick. Forest wants perfection and he needs it dammit for his
daughter-loss-mad-science-plan. By the way, Allison Pill is doing
solid work as Katie. She comes off wonderfully disconnected and a
little creepy.

Forest dismisses them and spends a moment tuning this backwards
projection machine to, guess what, spy on his past daughter blowing
bubbles.

Jamie pops up again to 

It's really frustrating to see how sloppily this plot is being
developed. Garland really did not need to hammer the viewer over the
head to get across that Forest is still dealing with his daughter's
loss. The Russian handler, while a moderately interesting plot device,
could have been played with so much more subtlety and intricacy.


Notes

- Nice little touch that the app doesn't do the pluralization
correctly and says "One More Fails Will Cause Data Wipe"

- Why do people's computers have like 10 windows open all with
  tiiiiinny text? Nobody can see that shit.

- Russian handler dude responds immediately to Lily's
messages. Responding immediately means that he has some sort of
notification for messages. But that'd be a dead giveaway for a secret
messaging app.

- In sci-fi has terrible lighting, why is Lily messaging Russian
  handler dude in a dark room?

- There's an awful lot of attention being paid to the homeless guy. He
  interacts with both Jamie and Sergei. Definitely going to play a
  bigger role.
