Do yourself a favor. Learn to cook. Not only is it easy, rewarding,
fun, intellectually stimulating, attractive, yadda yadda, it's a
pretty essential part of one's existence. Every human needs to consume
food to survive. It might be good to know how to make food.

You don't have to cook often, although practice will make you better.

Yes, yes, I know you're too busy creating a company/raising a
child/writing a novel to cook. But cooking doesn't always mean complex
meals made from scratch. Cooking can start with adding a boiled egg to
your package ramen. It can be saving your oversalted takeout with a
little acid. It can be making a grilled cheese. Don't overthink it.

Watch cooking videos. I started cooking a few years ago, but I watched
cooking videos for years and years before that. When I started
cooking, I was surprised to realize that I had all of this
knowledge. Cooking videos are often fun and easy watches. You can do
it while lazing around after work. There's whole bunch like Munchies,
Serious Eats, Bon Appetit, etc.

Buy [Salt Fat Acid
Heat](https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering/dp/1476753830). I've
tried to teach cooking to people, only to realize that they lack any
intuition about flavor. They don't understand how flavors combine and
how to adjust them. You can and should follow recipes, but more
important than that, you should know why recipes work. This book will
teach you that and much more. Not to mention Samin Nosrat is a
delightful writer.

Another wonderful book, especially for the more nerdy, is [The Food
Lab](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/10/how-to-make-simple-salad-worth-eating-vinaigrette.html).

Use more salt in your cooking. No, even more than that. Restaurant
food contains a shocking amount of salt and fat. You can stand to
season your food more. If you don't like your cooking, this is
probably why.

Learn to cook vegetables. You may discover that many vegetables you
previously disliked, when cooked properly, are absolutely
delicious. Season them properly and use enough fat. Vegetables don't
have natural fat, so they won't taste good without boosters like olive
oil or butter. It's okay. A few tablespoons of butter with some
collard greens is still mostly collard greens.

Stir frying vegetables is very easy and very rewarding. Get a leafy
green vegetable like spinach, swiss chard, broccoli rabe, kale,
etc. If you can find an Asian market, yu choy, mustard greens, napa
cabbage are all great options. Cut up some garlic. If you want, ginger
and hot peppers also go well. Cut up the greens. Heat oil in a pan
until oil starts to have little ripples (this is called shimmering in
recipe parlance), throw the garlic in (and ginger/hot peppers if you
have them), let it sizzle for a bit, then add the greens. Stir, making
sure to move the greens on the bottom to the top. Salt generously.

If the greens are too tough, add a few teaspoons of water and
cover. Let them steam for a few minutes.

Buy seasonal, local vegetables from high quality grocery
stores[^1]. Not only do seasonal, local vegetables taste better,
they're generally cheaper since they're in abundance and don't have to
flown from elsewhere. Go to farmers markets. Yes, they're more
expensive. They're still cheaper than a restaurant. Never buy out of
season tomatoes[^2].

Learn to make salads. Salads are one of the most maligned dishes. They
can be stunning if you buy good produce and make a good
vinaigrette. Good produce should have its own flavor, whether that's
the bitter pop of arugula, the sweetness of butter lettuce, the sting
of a radish. A [good
vinaigrette](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/10/how-to-make-simple-salad-worth-eating-vinaigrette.html)
is light, sharp and not complicated. You may find yourself eating a
large bowl of salad by yourself. Then wondering why most salads suck.

Your food will only be as good as your ingredients. You can buy the
fanciest sous vide machine, use the best dry brined reverse sear
blowtorch method, but your Costco chicken breast will still taste like
Costco chicken breast.

Are you a professional athlete? Are you attempting to be a
bodybuilder? Are you 6'8"? If not, skip the bulk packages of frozen
chicken breast. Chicken thighs are delicious too by the way. Roasting
whole chickens is also a great method.

Learn to use spices. Learn to find a balance between bland nothing and
overwhelming everything. You can order spices online for significantly
cheaper or look for a local spice shop. Often ethnic stores stock
spices on the cheap.

If you have family dishes that you like, ask for recipes. Better yet,
cook them with your relative. It's a good experience.

Find good recipes and follow them. You can modify once you understand
the fundamentals. Avoid using Google. You'll just get the food blog
that did the most SEO. I like [NYTimes](https://cooking.nytimes.com/),
[Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/) and [Bon
Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/). AllRecipes is not recommended
as the recipe quality is not vetted at all.

Learn to make and use condiments. Condiments are a great way to add
flavor to food, whether that's your own dishes or delivery. I like
[homemade
mayo](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/10/two-minute-mayonnaise.html),
[chili
crisp](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/04/homemade-spicy-chili-crisp.html)
and [doubanjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubanjiang) (buy this
one). Olive oil makes a delicious condiment on its own. Use some chili
crisp when making your mayo to get the best chili mayo ever.

Avoid bro cooking. Bro cooking is defined by overuse of bacon, excess
alcohol, meat meat meat, and an obsession with protein. You don't need
to assert your masculinity in your cooking. Don't fall into the trap
that cooking is feminine. It's not. Even if it was, there's nothing
wrong with feminine activities. If you genuinely like those elements,
then go ahead and enjoy your bacon wrapped steaks with a double
whiskey. But you don't need to make it your personality.

If your stove sucks, get an induction burner. They head up super
quickly, are lightweight and far better than most stoves.

Get a decent chef's knife and a reasonably large cutting board. Do
[your](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/06/the-best-chefs-knives.html)
[research](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-chefs-knife-for-most-cooks/)

Don't expect to be good at cooking at first. When you start out, a 30
minute recipe will take an hour; a recipe that looks gorgeous in the
photos will be flat on your plate; the food will be undersalted,
overcooked, not perfect; your greens will be cold by the time your
steak is ready. But the food will still be delicious. It will still
nourish you. It will still feed you and your loved ones.

Some of my best memories have come from meals I have made for
others. I hope you can experience that too.
