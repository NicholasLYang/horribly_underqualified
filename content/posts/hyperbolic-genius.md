There's a common trope in media where a character who is supposed to
be a genius (or honestly just very smart) has the most outrageous set
of credentials. Graduated from MIT at age 6. Has 7 PhDs. Brilliant at
5 independent subjects. Whatever.

These kind of bother me. Yes, I get it, the writers wanted a character
who's brilliant and giving them outrageous credentials is one way to
get that point across. But it's *lazy*. A character can be smart
without insane credentials. Plus sometimes the authors go a little too
far and give the characters accomplishments that just sound absurd. 7
PhDs? Who even has 7 subjects they find that interesting? Or the
requisite 20-something years to accomplish that?

I'm definitely thinking too much about this. But it does have an
influence. I don't think people genuinely understand what genius looks
like. Geniuses in media are always brilliant at 5 different subjects,
horribly tortured/quirky/mentally unstable. I'm not a genius but I do
know people who are. They're not brilliant at 5 different
subjects. Usually they're very good at 1, maybe 2 subjects.
