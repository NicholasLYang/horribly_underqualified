Have you ever watched a movie that you were convinced was absolutely,
utterly boring, that you knew was the stupidest concept in existence,
that was just not worth your time. Have you ever watched that movie
and discovered it was fantastic, brilliant, genius? I have.

And yet...I keep judging movies the same way. I sit down at my
computer, read the synopsis, and decide that nope, this movie is not
worth my time.
