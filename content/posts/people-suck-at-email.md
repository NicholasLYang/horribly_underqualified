Just because someone has not responded to an email in a few days
doesn't mean they're angry at you. It doesn't mean they don't like
you. It doesn't mean they want to stop talking to you. They most
likely forgot.

Expect to send at least a couple follow up emails. If the person you
are emailing is famous or important or a leader of some sorts, expect
to send even more emails. They have a lot on your mind and your email
can slip through the cracks.

In general assume forgetfulness or laziness before malice.
