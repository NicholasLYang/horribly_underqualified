Time for some clickbait! I've been going to hackathons for nearly two
years now. Recently I've become sort of jaded to them. You see,
hackathons in theory are great. You get to eat free food, meet
interesting hackers and programmers, write a cool project and maybe
win some prizes at the end. And in reality, the first two perks are
very much true. Hackathons are still a great place to meet people and
have fun.

But recently I've started to notice a few trends in the types of
projects that win. I'm not going to claim I'm some hackathon Oracle
(I'm not really a Java person anyways), but I've started to recognize
the projects that win and the projects that don't. And the projects
that do win often have certain *ahem* characteristics. So without
further ado, let me tell you about the 5 kinds of hackathon projects
(2-3 of which I'm totally guilty).

5. The Tutorial In Disguise

    You know, the project that suspiciously looks like a tutorial for
Tensorflow or OpenCV. Maybe it's a [traffic
analysis](https://medium.com/machine-learning-world/tutorial-making-road-traffic-counting-app-based-on-computer-vision-and-opencv-166937911660)
application. Or a [drawing
classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent_quickdraw)
app. Whatever the idea, it just happens to be a little too close to
the tutorial for comfort.

4. The Project That Makes Sense (Until It Doesn't)

    This project sounds like such a great idea. It's really neat, totally
innovative and might change the world. Unless you stop and think for a
second about it. Ideas like detecting emotion in 911 calls (It's
almost like that's the operator's job!), or figuring out when to restock an
item using computer vision (Why not a scale? It's less finicky, super
simple and probably cheaper). These ideas sound great when you learn
about them, but they fall apart with a bit of thinking.

3. The Totally Not Preplanned Project

    Y'know, the idea that requires an Arduino, a camera, some breadboards,
a soldering iron, the hair of a unicorn, maybe some fairy dust. But we
totally came up with the project at the hackathon! We didn't plan and
maybe start assembling the hardware beforehand! Sometimes this is just
the work of a hardware god. But othertimes it's just a liiiittle too
convenient that they had all these parts.

2. The "Trust Me"

    The projects that rely on the judges trusting the team and not
verifying. For instance, a trading model that promises 75%
return. Just don't ask for how long, the specific testing dates, and
whether the model will work going forward (Bitcoin looked like an
awfully good buy December 2017). Or a live translation app that
totally, um, works outside our preplanned demo. We swear!

1. The Plagiarism

    Okay, this one is actually totally not cool. You saw this idea win at
a previous hackathon. Judges loved it, other competitors grudgingly
admit it's pretty cool, overall a big success. And guess what? You'll
get to see the idea again and again at every single hackathon in the
season! A [sorting](https://devpost.com/software/sorty-mcsortface)
[trash can](https://devpost.com/software/bittobin) [for
instance](https://devpost.com/software/greencan). Oh sure it may be
under disguise. A sorting
[fridge](https://devpost.com/software/frigid) for instance. Granted,
some of these may be honest mistakes. It's often hard to remember if
an idea was genuinely unique or whether you're subconsciously copying
something you saw. Seriously! It's called
[cryptomnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomnesia) (new
hackathon idea, cryptomnesia detector).

And so I don't appear like the salty, jaded loser that I totally am,
how about I list 5 hackathon projects that I love.

5. The Weird Ones

    I love it when teams decide to just go off the rails and make a
completely weird, out there idea. Stuff like [turn signals, but for
people](https://devpost.com/software/x-but-for-y). Or a site that
checks if [someone is
single](https://devpost.com/software/single-or-naw-w01og3). I love it
when it's clear that the team isn't taking themselves too seriously
and are having fun.

4. The Ridiculously Technical Idea

    These ideas are ridiculously, completely over the top in terms of
their technicality. I've seen [scanning tunneling
microscopes](https://devpost.com/software/angstroms-matter-imaging-atoms),
[program analyzers using first order
logic](https://devpost.com/software/program-programmer), machine
learning on melodies. These ideas aren't going to win prizes because
they're too niche, too focused on the tech to pitch, but damn are they
cool.

3. Beginner Projects

    I really love seeing new hackers work on projects. People come in with
little to no experience, and manage to make something new and
fun. Sure, it may not work entirely, it may be hacked together from a
tutorial or two, but still, the fact that a person can come in with
only the basic knowledge of programming and come out with a project is
a testament to the best part of hackathons.

2. Beautiful Projects

    I'm a sucker for good design. Projects that have beautiful
interfaces and well designed sites are always nice to see. It means
the developers have put some work into polishing the project and
working on the little things. For instance, an [app that lets you
track dosage using AR](https://devpost.com/software/pillar-egulwv)
with a smooth, slick user interface.

1. Deployed Projects

    I'm a big believer in deploying projects. Sure, a demo running on a
laptop is nice, but it's a completely different experience when you
can see the project up and running on your own device. Ideas like a
site that allows you to [redraw congressional
districts](https://devpost.com/software/gerry) or [Slack based
cooperative gaming](https://devpost.com/software/kokorawr) are just
that much cooler when you can try them out yourself.

In conclusion, I still like hackathons. They're great ways to get
people to program for fun and to branch out both in terms of tech and
ideas. And free food is always nice. But I wish that judges and
organizers would be a little better at discouraging projects that are
all smoke and mirrors and plagiarism, while encouraging projects that
are fun, technical and weird. Projects that are deployed and
polished. Hackathons are only going to get more popular with more
people attending them every year. Let's hope that we can make them
better for everyone.
