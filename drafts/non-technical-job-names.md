If you've looked for jobs online, you've probably experienced the
following situation: You're scrolling down the list of jobs when you
see a job with a vaguely technical title. But then when you look at
the job requirements, there's no programming languages and frameworks,
no explanation of development workflows or platforms. Congrats, you've
found the non-technical technical job.

I'll preface this post with a disclaimer: Non-technical technical jobs
are NOT bad jobs. Nobody should be looked down upon for having one or
applying for one. The shame is wholly on the company for using
deceptive naming.

Anyways, these jobs tend to follow the same pattern. The name has to
evoke feelings of tech, without contradicting the actual job. One
technique is to take one technical word, e.g. "architect" or
"engineer", and slap it onto another non-technical word. For instance,
"Sales Engineer" or "Solutions Architect" both kinda sound like
technical jobs. But really, they're not. Oh, sure, maybe you'll write
a couple pieces of code or a few scripts, but it's not the same as a
full time development job.
