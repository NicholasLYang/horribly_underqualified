I've been at NYU for two years now and in that time I've interacted
with a lot of CS majors. One commonality which I've noticed is a lack
of autodidactism. Autodidactism, for those who are not familiar,
refers to one's ability to teach themselves. In my opinion,
autodidactism is one of the key characteristics of a good
programmer. To put it more bluntly, a good coder should be able to
"figure it out", whatever "it" may be. Gotta deploy your code? Figure
it out! Need to learn a new language? Figure it out!

Autodidactism is a pretty important skill because, well, when you're
out in the field, nobody's going to walk you through every new problem
that you encounter. A good programmer should be able to solve problems
by gathering evidence, thinking and most importantly, *learning*. If
you can't learn on your own, you can't tackle all the problems you'll
face in programming.

This isn't to say that programmers should go without
mentorship. Sometimes you just need to have something explained to
you. What I am saying is that a good programmer is willing to at least
*try* to teach themselves. Unfortunately, this isn't as common as I'd
hope. NYU CS students don't even *dream* of learning outside of class.

Of course, there's some problems with autodidactism. One problem in
particular that I've been struggling to tackle is
attrition. Basically, kids don't stick with programming
projects. Specifically, I want to discuss attrition of people who are
underrepresented in tech. I've been wondering if emphasizing self
teaching has been hurting people who don't feel comfortable in tech. A
person who is representative of most programmers, i.e. white, male,
etc., may be willing to persist more, simply because they're not
plagued by doubts about whether or not they belong. To be clear here,
I'm not saying anything about technical skill. Just that it's easy to
leave the party if you're already feeling unwelcome.

My immediate instinct to tackle this issue is to provide more in depth
mentoring. But herein lies my dilemma: how do I mentor people without
negating the importance of autodidactism? One characteristic of NYU CS
students which I truly despise is the pervasive **learned
helplessness**[^1]. Learned helplessness manifests itself as an
unwillingness or inability to tackle hard problems. If you ask someone
with learned helplessness to make a database schema, they'll
immediately ask you how to do it or give up. They won't try to teach
themselves and they won't persist.

[^1]: I'm aware I'm terribly misusing psychology terminology. Bear
    with me here.

And with a naive form of mentoring, i.e. mentee comes to mentor with
problem, mentor gives advice, mentee goes back to work, it's quite
easy to send up in an overly dependent relationship. The way schools
are set up exacerbates this problem. In school, a teacher will tell
you exactly what will be covered and whether or not it'll be on the
test. If there's a topic that the teacher didn't mention, why bother
learning it? It won't help your grade. And if a problem shows up on
material the teacher didn't cover? That's their fault, not
yours. After all, how could you have possibly known that topic? 

In contrast, when a mentee encounters a problem that the mentor hasn't
covered, their first instinct should be to tackle the problem on their
own. Which begs the question, how do we encourage new developers to do
this?
