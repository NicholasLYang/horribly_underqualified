Programming is magic. Well, about as close as you or I am going to get
to magic. It is the act of creation. It is the process of spinning a
spell that does a task, whether that is identifying an object,
searching your music library or simply finding a good Italian
restaurant. This act of creation, of taking theory and placing into
reality, is not a skill that should be taken lightly. Arthur C
Clarke's famous quote comes to mind: "Any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from magic." Indeed, as technology
progresses, as we create these seemingly magical monstrosities, we
cannot fail to recognize that with magic, with incantations and
inspirations, comes a dark side, comes malintent, comes malice. Facial
recognition, preternatural data analysis, social media, all of these
and much more are the pinnacles, the peaks of our labor. But as the
peaks, they act also as the foci of greed and hubris. The facial
recognition software that opens a phone, may be used to hunt a
human. The data analysis that suggests new songs may be used to spy on
us all. The social media that keeps families and friends in touch may
be used to swing an election.

We can no longer wait. Programmers, any and all, students and senior
developers alike, we must create a way of meting out this magic. We
must recognize the power that we hold. The slogan "Changing the world"
has been interpreted as a joke, a sense of overimportance from a bunch
of techies. But the truth is quite the opposite; we, programmers,
*are* changing the world. And that is terrifying.
